"""
MCP SERVER -- exposing your RAG tools over the Model Context Protocol
=======================================================================
What this is, compared to everything you've built so far:

  rag_chat_llm.py / streamlit_agentic_rag.py
      -> ONE specific LangChain agent (with ONE specific LLM: llama3.1)
         calls your tools directly, inside that one Python program.

  THIS FILE (mcp_policy_server_old.py)
      -> Turns search_policy and raise_hr_ticket into an MCP SERVER --
         a standalone process that exposes these tools over a standard
         protocol (MCP) so that ANY MCP-compatible client can use them:
         Claude Desktop, Claude Code, another LangChain/LangGraph agent,
         or any other tool that speaks MCP. Your tools are no longer
         locked inside one script -- they become a reusable service.

Think of it like this: your previous scripts BUILT a chef who can cook
from a specific recipe book. This file turns the recipe book itself
into a menu that any restaurant (any MCP client) can order from.

SETUP:
    pip install "mcp[cli]" requests langchain-huggingface langchain-community \
                faiss-cpu langchain-text-splitters --break-system-packages

NOTE ON MCP SDK VERSION: this script targets mcp>=2.0.0 (released July 2026),
which renamed the old FastMCP class to MCPServer and moved its import path
from mcp.server.fastmcp to mcp.server. If you installed an older mcp<2.0.0,
either upgrade (pip install --upgrade "mcp[cli]") or swap the import back to
`from mcp.server.fastmcp import FastMCP` and use `FastMCP(...)` instead of
`MCPServer(...)` below -- the @mcp.tool() decorator usage is identical either way.

THREE TOOLS ARE EXPOSED HERE, ON PURPOSE, TO SHOW A CONTRAST:
    - search_policy       -> LOCAL only (reads your own FAISS index on disk)
    - raise_hr_ticket     -> MOCK only (hardcoded fake string, no real call)
    - check_public_holiday -> Calls YOUR OWN local API (holiday_api.py),
                               backed by YOUR OWN local SQLite database
                               (holidays.db) -- built via a 3-step pipeline:
                                 1. create_holiday_db.py  -> builds holidays.db
                                 2. holiday_api.py         -> FastAPI service
                                    in front of that DB (run with:
                                    uvicorn holiday_api:app --port 8000)
                                 3. THIS file               -> MCP tool that
                                    calls that local API over HTTP
                               This replaced an earlier version that called
                               a public third-party API (date.nager.at),
                               which was unreliable/unresponsive -- now you
                               control the data and the uptime yourself.

BEFORE RUNNING THIS SERVER, MAKE SURE:
    1. python create_holiday_db.py          (one-time, builds holidays.db)
    2. uvicorn holiday_api:app --port 8000   (leave this running in its
                                               own terminal)
    then run this MCP server as usual.

RUNNING IT DIRECTLY (for quick manual testing, prints raw MCP traffic):
    mcp dev mcp_policy_server_old.py

CONNECTING IT TO CLAUDE DESKTOP:
    1. Open Claude Desktop's config file:
         macOS: ~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
         Windows: %APPDATA%\\Claude\\claude_desktop_config.json
    2. Add an entry like this (adjust the path to where this file lives):

       {
         "mcpServers": {
           "company-policy": {
             "command": "python",
             "args": ["/full/path/to/mcp_policy_server_old.py"]
           }
         }
       }

    3. Restart Claude Desktop. You'll see "search_policy" and
       "raise_hr_ticket" available as tools Claude can call directly
       in a normal conversation -- no LangChain agent code needed on
       the client side at all, MCP handles that wiring.
