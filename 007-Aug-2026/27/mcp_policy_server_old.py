MCP SERVER -- exposing your RAG tools over the Model Context Protocol
=======================================================================
What this is, compared to everything you've built so far:

  rag_chat_llm.py / streamlit_agentic_rag.py
      -> ONE specific LangChain agent (with ONE specific LLM: llama3.1)
         calls your tools directly, inside that one Python program.

  THIS FILE (mcp_policy_server_old.py)
      -> Turns search_policy and raise_hr_ticket into an MCP SERVER --
         a standalone process that exposes these tools over a standard
         protocol (MCP) so that ANY MCP-compatible client can use them:
         Claude Desktop, Claude Code, another LangChain/LangGraph agent,
         or any other tool that speaks MCP. Your tools are no longer
         locked inside one script -- they become a reusable service.

Think of it like this: your previous scripts BUILT a chef who can cook
from a specific recipe book. This file turns the recipe book itself
into a menu that any restaurant (any MCP client) can order from.

SETUP:
    pip install mcp requests langchain-huggingface langchain-community faiss-cpu \
                langchain-text-splitters --break-system-packages

THREE TOOLS ARE EXPOSED HERE, ON PURPOSE, TO SHOW A CONTRAST:
    - search_policy       -> LOCAL only (reads your own FAISS index on disk)
    - raise_hr_ticket     -> MOCK only (hardcoded fake string, no real call)
    - check_public_holiday -> REAL EXTERNAL call (hits date.nager.at, a live
                               free public-holiday API, over the internet,
                               and returns real current data)

RUNNING IT DIRECTLY (for quick manual testing, prints raw MCP traffic):
    mcp dev mcp_policy_server_old.py

CONNECTING IT TO CLAUDE DESKTOP:
    1. Open Claude Desktop's config file:
         macOS: ~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
         Windows: %APPDATA%\\Claude\\claude_desktop_config.json
    2. Add an entry like this (adjust the path to where this file lives):

       {
         "mcpServers": {
           "company-policy": {
             "command": "python",
             "args": ["/full/path/to/mcp_policy_server_old.py"]
           }
         }
       }

    3. Restart Claude Desktop. You'll see "search_policy" and
       "raise_hr_ticket" available as tools Claude can call directly
       in a normal conversation -- no LangChain agent code needed on
       the client side at all, MCP handles that wiring.

# MCP client.

    after the user has explicitly confirmed they want the action taken --
    never call this just because a policy question was asked."""

    # actual HTTPS request over the internet to a live third-party service
    # (Nager.Date, a free public-holiday API, no API key required) and
    # returns REAL, current data -- not something stored in this script.

# 3. RUN THE SERVER

# stdio transport: the client (Claude Desktop, `mcp dev`, etc.) launches
# this script as a subprocess and talks to it over stdin/stdout using
# the MCP protocol. This is the standard local-server transport.
