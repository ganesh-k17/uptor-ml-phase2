STREAMLIT AGENTIC RAG -- WITH SEMANTIC CHUNKING + RE-RANKING
==============================================================
Same agent, same tools, same Streamlit chat UI as before.
TWO things upgraded vs your previous version:

  1. CHUNKING: RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter (character-count based)
     ->  SemanticChunker (splits where the MEANING actually shifts,
         not where a fixed character count runs out)

  2. RETRIEVAL: plain FAISS similarity search only
     ->  FAISS retrieves a wider pool of candidates first, then a
         CROSS-ENCODER re-ranks those candidates by how well each one
         actually answers the question, and only the top few (after
         re-ranking) are handed to the agent

Why both matter together: semantic chunking gives you cleaner,
topic-coherent chunks going IN. Re-ranking gives you more accurate
chunk selection coming OUT (at query time). Chunking quality and
retrieval quality are two separate problems -- this script upgrades
both.

RUN THIS WITH:
    streamlit run streamlit_agentic_rag_semantic_rerank.py

SETUP (adds two new packages vs your previous script):
    pip install streamlit langchain langchain-ollama langchain-huggingface \
                langchain-community langchain-experimental sentence-transformers \
                faiss-cpu --break-system-packages
