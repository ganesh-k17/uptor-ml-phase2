rag_engine.py -- SHARED CORE, used by BOTH streamlit_full_harness.py and
mcp_server_full.py. This is deliberate: instead of duplicating the FAISS
setup, tools, and prompt in two files (like your earlier scripts did),
both front-ends import from this ONE place. Change a tool here, both
apps get the fix.

This file implements every piece from the "Core Components of a Harness"
breakdown, each clearly labeled below:

    1. TOOL LOOPS        -> search_policy, raise_hr_ticket, check_public_holiday
    2. FEEDFORWARD GUIDE  -> SYSTEM_PROMPT
    3. FEEDBACK SENSOR    -> groundedness_check()
    4. STATE & MEMORY     -> SQLite-backed conversation log (persists across
                             restarts, unlike a plain Python list or
                             st.session_state alone)

SETUP:
    pip install -r requirements.txt --break-system-packages
    pip install langchain-experimental sentence-transformers fastapi uvicorn --break-system-packages
    ollama pull llama3.1

BEFORE FIRST RUN:
    python create_holiday_db.py
    uvicorn holiday_api:app --port 8000   (leave running in its own terminal)
